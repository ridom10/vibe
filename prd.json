      "description": "Create a clean SpinWheel component using HTML5 Canvas (not Three.js - lighter weight). The wheel should: (1) Be a simple circle divided into equal segments, (2) Each segment shows the option text, centered and readable, (3) Use a clean sans-serif font (system-ui), (4) Subtle segment dividers (thin lines, 0.5px, low opacity), (5) Muted color palette - soft grays, whites, one accent color. No gradients or shadows. Think Apple Wallet card simplicity.",

      "description": "Implement butter-smooth spin animation: (1) Use requestAnimationFrame for 60fps, (2) Easing: start fast, decelerate naturally (cubic-bezier or custom easing), (3) Spin duration 3-4 seconds total, (4) Random final position (lands on winner), (5) No wobble or bounce - clean stop. The deceleration should feel physical and satisfying, like a real wheel slowing down. Test on mobile to ensure no frame drops.",

      "description": "Add a minimal pointer to show the winning segment: (1) Simple triangle or arrow at the top of the wheel, (2) Static (doesn't move), (3) Subtle - same accent color as UI, (4) Maybe a thin line extending to wheel edge. No bouncing, no sounds on tick. Clean and understated.",

Just a clean, confident highlight that says 'this is your answer'. Apple-level restraint.",
