      "title": "Beautiful Starfield Background",
      "description": "The background is currently black/empty - glitter particles are NOT visible. CRITICAL BUG: Camera is at z=8, but particles are at z=5-15 which puts them BEHIND the camera! Fix: Move particles to z=-15 to z=-3 (BEHIND the cards, in front of camera). Spread particles wider (50x50). Make stars MUCH brighter - increase opacity, larger sizes (0.15-0.4 for stars). Add color variation (cyan #22d3ee, purple #a855f7, white). The background should be a beautiful starfield that users notice immediately.",

Each row has: (1) Cyan numbered badge on left (1, 2, 3), (2) Option text centered, (3) X delete button on right (desktop) or swipe-delete (mobile). Subtle separator lines. Smooth slide-in animations. Scrollable if many items. Header shows 'Your options (4/12)'. Should look like a premium settings list, not scattered pills. Clean typography, good spacing.",

Use framer-motion for all transitions. The app should flow like butter between states.",
